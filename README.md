# Graph Generator and Visualizer

**Graph Generator and Visualizer** is a C++ application built with .NET managed resources for automatic graph generation, visualization, and algorithmic analysis.  
The project integrates computational logic with visual representation, providing a framework for exploring core concepts in graph theory and network analysis.

## Overview
The system dynamically generates and displays graph structures while enabling visualization of algorithmic paths.  
It supports both structural and path-finding algorithms, offering an illustrative way to study their behavior and outcomes.

## Implementation
- Core logic implemented in **C++**  
- Managed resources and UI components built with **.NET Framework**    

## Supported Algorithms
- **Hamiltonian Path / Cycle**  
- **Eulerian Path / Circuit**  
- **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path**  
- **Maximum Flow (Ford–Fulkerson)**  

## Features
- Automatic graph generation with adjustable parameters  
- Visual rendering of nodes, edges, and algorithmic progress  
- Highlighted paths and flows during algorithm execution  
- Modular architecture allowing easy extension with new algorithms
- Automatic export of step-by-step graph images for each algorithm run  

## Potential Extensions
- Additional algorithms (Prim’s, Kruskal’s, A*, etc.)  
- Export of graph data and visualization snapshots  
- Enhanced layout and styling for large graph rendering
